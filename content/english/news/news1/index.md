Step 1
Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large-sized bowl.

Step 3
Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan.

Step 4
Pour 1‚ÅÑ4 cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
