Psyllium husk powder is ground up husk from Psyllium Plantago seeds. Psyllium husk powder is used in creating fiber-based laxatives and in high-fiber cereals. Psyllium husk powder is not digested but absorbs water as it moves through the digestive system. Another benefit of the powder is the reduction of low-density lipoproteins, also known as bad cholesterol, in diets designed to lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce weight.
